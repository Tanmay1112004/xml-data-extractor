# 🚀 XML Data Extractor & Visualizer

**Turn complex XML into clear, actionable insights in seconds.**

---

## 📌 Overview

XML data is often dense and difficult to read. This project provides a **modern, end-to-end web application** built with **Python** and **Gradio** that simplifies the entire workflow—from parsing and cleaning to advanced visualization.

Whether you're debugging enterprise-level XML files or exploring data for a research project, this tool bridges the gap between raw code and visual clarity.
